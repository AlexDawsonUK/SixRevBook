# Six Revisions Book

This is the website of the Six Revisions book. A collection of 45 Articles for Web Developers written by me while I was the lead contributor to the now defunct (though taken over) Web Design blog Six Revisions. Unfortunately the current hosts have seen fit to take credit for my work so I've decided to compile all of my articles into a single PDF volume available for free. While much of the information is likely out of date there will still be some useful nuggets in there for designers and developers, plus some interesting historical knowledge for others.
